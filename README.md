## Updating Data

To update the data used by your project, follow these steps:

1. Locate the `public/data.json` file in your project directory. You can access it [here](https://github.com/GDSC-UVPCE/GCCP-Jams/blob/main/public/data.json).

2. Replace the contents of `data.json` with your own JSON data. You can manually edit the file or use a tool to generate the JSON data from other sources.

3. Save the changes to `data.json`.

That's it! Your project should now use the updated data.
